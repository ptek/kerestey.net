Lately I have started following bandcamp more closely and their "Monthly Best
Of" section is fantastic for exploting and learning music I did not know I
like.

My latest discovery from [The Best Jazz on Bandcamp: May
2020](https://daily.bandcamp.com/best-jazz/the-best-jazz-on-bandcamp-may-2020)
is an Aaron Parks album ["Little Big
II"](https://aaronparksmusic.bandcamp.com/album/little-big-ii-dreams-of-a-mechanical-man)
